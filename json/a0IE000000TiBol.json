         "tasting_note": "This wine is named for an enterprising, entrepreneurial family that emigrated from Italy to New York in 1921 – and persevered despite threats from The Black Hand mafia. Made in a fresh, approachable, modern style, yet possessing the classic structure and finesse of wines from Northwest Italy’s sun-exposed hills of Asti, this Barbera shows delicately interwoven characters of red plum, dried cherry, leather, herbs and cranberry-like acidity. Just as the Tornambes do, enjoy this smooth red alongside pasta Bolognese, grilled meat dishes or seafood pasta in red sauce.",

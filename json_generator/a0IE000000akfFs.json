         "tasting_note": "This Malbec presents characteristic aromas of roasted strawberry, black cherry and plum, which carry through on the palate. The tannins are very young at the moment, so be sure to aerate this wine in order to enjoy its secondary notes of floral spice, cedar, vanilla and earth. Pair this versatile and agreeable red with strongly flavored foods such as Indian curry, game bird or blue cheese."

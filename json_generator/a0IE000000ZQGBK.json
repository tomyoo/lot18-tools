         "tasting_note": "This youthful wine presents very complex aromas of blueberry, black cherry, cedar, tobacco, red currant and fig. Dense and rich, the blackberry and cedar notes charge the palate with great density and richness. Fig, chocolate and plum skin are the secondary aromas as well as flavors that present with more time open and exposure to air - I recommend decanting this wine in its youth to show all the expressive nature Lettieri Petite Sirah has to offer. Enjoy this wine with anything from the grill from beef short ribs, to smoked meats and sausages to grilled veggies and lamb skewers."

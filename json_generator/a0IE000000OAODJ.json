         "tasting_note": "Light and elegant at first, this wine might smell and taste a bit like a subdued Bordeaux white â€“ but it's just being shy. With air and a little warming in the glass, the wine slowly starts to reveal the signature grass, passion fruit, citrus and Meyer lemon flavors that make New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc special. A subtle, Old World-style minerality runs through the length of the wine, start to finish, carrying with it a subtle nectarine note. The wine finishes very clean and pure, making it great to drink on its own or with light seafood dishes and salads."
